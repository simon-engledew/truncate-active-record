Truncate Active Record
======================
                                                                 
Opens up the SQLite3 conenction adapter and adds a truncate method which behaves similarly to the SQL truncate command, deleting all records in the database and resetting the auto-increment ID.
Returns the number of deleted records.

Currently only works with SQLite3 (for obvious reasons)


Example
=======

Post.truncate
=> 4
